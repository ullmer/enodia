Question 13

Georgia Tech Professor Thad Starner (a key contributor to the Tangible Bits paper) for many
years used the signature line: "you have 50 years; how do you wish to change the world?"

In Q7, you completed a storyboard and accompanying description of a TEI
system that engaged RRR in SSS context.  For this question, you can 
either "bend" that system, or propose a new system, to be realized in 
10 years, under the following descriptions of *a* (not *the*) possible future
at that time.  You should explicitly engage all of these constraints.  
Be specific.

Your system is to "entangle" two ~cubic-meter spaces, toward the ends of bringing people together. Regarding these spaces, 
 
 - (a) one is inside of the United States -- but more than 15 miles from Clemson; and
 - (b) one is outside of the terrestrial United States (and not necessarily upon Earth).

First: for each of these, please pick *one* of the options proposed by you
during the final class.

Next, choose the specific day, time, and time zone, sometime within 2032.



** A options:**
- 

** B options:**
- Butchart Gardens (Victoria, BC, Canada)
