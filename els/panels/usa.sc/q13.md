Question 13

Georgia Tech Professor Thad Starner (a key contributor to the Tangible Bits paper) for many
years used the signature line: "you have 50 years; how do you wish to change the world?"

In Q7, you completed a storyboard and accompanying description of a TEI
system that engaged RRR in SSS context.  For this question, you can 
either "bend" that system, or propose a new system, to be realized in 
10 years, under the following descriptions of *a* (not *the*) possible future
at that time.  You should explicitly engage all of these constraints.  
Be specific.
